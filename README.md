# Condition of Access

By login to our cluster, you agree that you have fully read our guidelines and
agree to our usage terms, including but not limited to our fairshare and queuing
policy. Violating our [Usage Guidelines](guideline.md) with or without knowledge
will lead to account suspension and/or disciplinary actions.

## What is this?

This repository serves as a knowledge base to help users get started in
[utilizing a GPU cluster](basics.md).

The main use case of this cluster is to run your GPU training code, presumably
written in Python and managed by [conda](conda.md). We DO NOT provide graphical
access and provide only [shell access via SSH](login.md). Execution of anything
irrelevant to your study/research at NTU is considered an offense and can lead
to disciplinary actions and/or more.

It is possible to [use VSCode and PyCharm to access the cluster](debugging.md).
Other possibilities exist, but we cannot cover all of them.

## What is the bare minimum that I need to know?

We expect all users to be highly familiarized with our
[Usage Guidelines](guideline.md) and will act accordingly, **including issuing
warnings and/or account bans**.

We also highly recommend going through the [Cluster Overview](cluster.md) as we
have many customized functions that may be different from other clusters you
might have used in the past.

Refer to other parts of our documentation as necessary.

## List of Guides

To keep things manageable, we have split this guide into multiple files.

### Supported Workflow
- [Login to login node](login.md).
- Do simple setup on login node
  ([create your Conda env and install packages](conda.md))
- [Request GPU node(s)](slurm.md) to debug/run your code.
