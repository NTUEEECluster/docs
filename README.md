# NTU EEE Cluster 02 Guide

To keep things manageable, we have split this into multiple files.

Pick the most relevant guide:

- Having trouble logging in? [Login Guide](login.md)
- How do I access (more) GPUs? [Slurm Introduction](slurm.md)
- What GPUs do I have access to? [Cluster Overview](cluster.md)
- How to run IDEs and debug? [Debugging Guide](Debugging.md)
- I am encountering an error. [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md)

- I have used a HPC before. What's the tl;dr? [Cluster Overview](cluster.md)

## What is this?

This repository serves as a simple knowledge base to help users get started in
utilizing a GPU cluster.

## Still need help?

Send us an email from your email to our email (it should be the email that you
received your credentials from) with the following details:

- What you have done: What commands have you ran?
- What you expect to happen: What should you be seeing?
- What actually happens: What is the actual output?

Please provide as much relevant information as you can to help us debug your
issue.  

## **Code of Conduct**

The EEE GPU Cluster is maintained by a small group of administrators who also have their own academic, professional, and personal commitments.  
While we strive to keep the cluster operational, please note that **updates, fixes, or password resets may be delayed**.

### **1. Scope of Support**
- Administrators are **only responsible for cluster-related issues** (hardware, system software, storage, scheduling, etc.).  
- We will **not** provide support for debugging or fixing your own code.

### **2. Data Availability & Security**
- We make every reasonable effort to keep your data secure and available.  
- **However, this is not guaranteed**, as our storage capacity and redundancy are limited.

### **3. Fair Usage & Queueing**
- If you need to wait in the job queue, please understand that **all users under the same organization have equal priority**.
- Respect other users’ right to access resources.
- Do **not** exploit bugs or loopholes. If you discover one, **report it immediately** to the administrators.  
- **Repeated abuse without reporting will result in account suspension or permanent bans**.

### **4. Permitted Use**
- The cluster is for **research and project-related computing** only.
- **Absolutely prohibited activities** include:
  - Running **illegal, unlicensed, or pirated software**.
  - Running **malicious software**, including viruses, worms, or denial-of-service scripts.
- **If you run illegal or unlicensed software:**
  - **You are solely and fully responsible** for any and all consequences, including but not limited to:
    - Permanent loss of cluster access.
    - Financial penalties, including damages claimed by copyright or IP owners.
    - Disciplinary actions by your school, university, or relevant authorities.
  - The administrators have **warned you in advance** and will **not bear any responsibility** for your actions.

### **5. Resource Ownership & Access Levels**
- The cluster hardware is funded by **multiple entities** at a cost of millions.
- Some GPU models or nodes may have restricted access based on the funding source’s policies.
- Please **respect these access limitations**, or discuss additional resource contributions with your supervisor.
