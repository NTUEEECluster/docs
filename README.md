# NTU EEE Cluster 02 Guide

To keep things manageable, we have split this into multiple files.

Pick the most relevant guide:

- Having trouble logging in? [Login Guide](login.md)
- How do I access (more) GPUs? [Slurm Introduction](slurm.md)
- What GPUs do I have access to? [Cluster Overview](cluster.md)
- How to run IDEs and debug? [Debugging Guide](Debugging.md)
- I am encountering an error. [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md)

- I have used a HPC before. What's the tl;dr? [Cluster Overview](cluster.md)

## What is this?

This repository serves as a simple knowledge base to help users get started in
utilizing a GPU cluster.

## Still need help?

Send us an email from your email to our email (it should be the email that you
received your credentials from) with the following details:

- What you have done: What commands have you ran?
- What you expect to happen: What should you be seeing?
- What actually happens: What is the actual output?

Please provide as much relevant information as you can to help us debug your
issue.

## Code of Conduct  
EEE GPU cluster is currently maintained by a small group of people who are also very busy on their own studies/careers/life. Updates/Fixs/PasswordReset can be delayed.
We do not and will not help you if you having issues with the code you wrote and only responsible for issues related to the cluster.
We try out best to make sure your data is secure and available. However, this is not to be taken as a guarantee as we are limited by our storage 
solutions for now. If you found yourself need to wait in the queue before your jobs can be run, please respect other users because they are assigned 
with equal accessibility as you and therefore the Administrator will also respect their right to run their jobs. User should be avare that all these servers
included in this cluster are costing millions and funded by different entities. The cluster admins fully respects the will of the owners and if that results in reduced 
level of accessibility for certain model of GPUs, please respect such limitations or ask your supervisor to contribute more resource to us financially.
