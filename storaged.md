# Storage Manager Usage

Compared to a private server, we manage your storage space a bit differently. Please see the details below.

---

## Home Directory Quota
- A **universal 50 GB limit** is applied to your home directory.
- **Note for early users:** If you have already used more than 50 GB in your home directory, you are expected to **migrate your data as soon as possible** into project directories.

---

## Storage Manager (`storagemgr`)
- You can call `storagemgr` in your terminal to invoke the **interactive storage manager UI**.
- Through this UI, you can request **additional project directories** with higher disk quotas.
- Based on your **account type**, storage manager will prompt your total disk quota.
- Your overall quota is mainly determined by how much space do we have physically. We will update this actively if we have more storage.
- Your project directories always appears under `/projects`. Note: it is `/projects` not `projects`.

---

## Example: HDD Storage Quota
If your quota on HDD storage is **5.0 TB**, you can either:
- Request **1 project directory** that uses all 5.0 TB,  
  *or*
- Create **5 project directories**, each with a 1.0 TB quota.
- You need to define your own uniquely named project directory. Duplicated name will result in failure to create your project directories.

---

## Naming Rules for Projects
- **No restrictions** on project names, but follow these rules:
  - **Do not** use NSFW or offensive words. Violations will result in a **direct and immediate ban**.
  - Use a **unique and identifiable name**, so you donâ€™t forget which folder is yours.
