# Usage Guidelines

The EEE GPU Cluster is maintained by a small group of administrators who also
have their own academic, professional, and personal commitments. While we
strive to keep the cluster operational, please note that **updates, fixes, or
password resets may be delayed**. As such, you are recommended to check
[troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md) where we list some issues
encountered by users in the past.

## 1. Scope of Support
- Administrators are **only responsible for cluster-related issues** (hardware,
  system software, storage, scheduling, etc.).
- We will **not** provide support for debugging or fixing your own code.

## 2. Data Availability & Security
- We make every reasonable effort to keep your data secure and available.
- **However, this is not guaranteed**, as our storage capacity and redundancy are limited.

## 3. Fair Usage & Queueing
- **Use compute nodes for heavy workloads**. Login nodes are low-powered to
  provide everyone with the most computational power as possible and are easily
  overwhelmed.
- If you need to wait in the job queue, please understand that **all users
  under the same organization have equal priority**.
- Respect other users’ right to access resources.
- Do **not** exploit bugs or loopholes. If you discover one, **report it
  immediately** to the administrators.  
- **Repeated abuse without reporting will result in account suspension and/or
  permanent bans**.

## 4. Permitted Use
- The cluster is for **research and project-related computing** only.
- **Absolutely prohibited activities** include:
  - Running **illegal, unlicensed, or pirated software**.
  - Running **malicious software**, including viruses, worms, or scripts that
    would otherwise prevent other users from accessing the service.
- **If you run illegal or unlicensed software:**
  - **You are solely and fully responsible** for any and all consequences,
    including but not limited to:
    - Permanent loss of cluster access.
    - Financial penalties, including damages claimed by copyright or IP owners.
    - Disciplinary actions by your school, university, or relevant authorities.
  - The administrators have **warned you in advance** and will **not bear any
    responsibility** for your actions.

## 5. Resource Ownership & Access Levels
- The cluster hardware is funded by **multiple entities** at a cost of millions.
- Some GPU models or nodes may have restricted access based on the funding
  source’s policies.
- Please **respect these access limitations**, or discuss additional resource
  contributions with your supervisor.
