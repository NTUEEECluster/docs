# Application Process

The application portal opens at the start of each semester and closes one month
after the portal opens.

- Applications are reviewed weekly (typically Fridays).
- Once the application is approved, the account is typically created on
  Mondays. Only email admins if you still cannot login on Tuesday.
- Requests to expedite the application process will be ignored. You are
  encouraged to apply early if you anticipate urgent need for GPUs.

Outside the application window, the cluster team cannot process registrations
because we are occupied with maintenance, monitoring, and procuring more
hardware for the cluster.

> NOTE: Usage is limited strictly to your assigned quota; no special quota
> increases are available.

## Exceptions

We always welcome new stakeholders who are able to directly contribute hardware
as we believe this will benefit our existing users as well.

We understand that new stakeholders will typically need to retain access to
their own hardware. As such, we will expedite user creation in this case to
facilitate the hardware transfer.

As a rough guideline, we are looking for the following types of hardware:
- Professional GPUs (to deploy more compute nodes)
- 15.36 TB Gen5 SSDs (to increase user/project storage)
- Enterprise Network Switches/Cables/NICs (ideally capable of 100Gbe)
- Enterprise CPU Servers (to spread the load of our control plane)
