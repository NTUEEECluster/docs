# Application Process

- The application portal opens at the start of each semester and closes one month after the portal opens.
- Submit your application through the portal; applications are reviewed weekly and requests to expedite will be ignored.
- Outside the application window, the cluster team cannot process registrations because we are occupied with maintenance and monitoring.
- Usage is limited strictly to your assigned quota; no special quota increases are available.
- The only way to register outside the application window is by becoming a stakeholder who directly contributes hardware (e.g., professional GPUs, 15.36 TB Gen5 SSDs, enterprise network switches/cables/NICs, enterprise CPU servers).
