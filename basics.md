## What is a GPU cluster?

GPU cluster conists many GPU servers. Your training/inference job gets distributed automatically by a job scheduler. This allows us to serve more users.

## What's in it for me?

Instead of waiting someone that is occupying your assigned GPU server to finish their business, you wait in a queue that as soon as one machine in the cluster is idling, you get the chance to run your code on this machine.

Your data is always synced on all GPU servers in the cluster. When you switch between servers, your data stays the same.

## How do I interact with the cluster?

You need to be familiar with interacting Linux-based systems via termianls. See this: [What are shell, bash, and terminal?](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0010.php)

In other words, you type what you need via Terminals. This is different from Windows where you click buttons to achieve what you want.

For our cluster, you need to SSH (i.e., remote connect) into our cluster and instruct the servers to achieve what you want. Your laptop will essentially be a remote terminal and your laptop don't have to be a cooking pan when running codes. [What's SSH?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v45p_kJV9i4)
